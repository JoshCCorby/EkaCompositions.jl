# Publication permissions register

Reviewed **31 August 2026**. This is an evidence and release-handling register,
not a legal opinion. The reviewed source-only archive is ready as a release
candidate; this does not approve a separate MP record-level data bundle.

## Code decision and ownership limits

Joshua Corbett selected **MIT** and confirmed that no applicable institutional
IP exceptions or assignment obligations apply to this project on 31 August
2026. On that owner declaration, the root [MIT licence](../LICENSE) is now
applied to Eka's original code, documentation and original test material.
This records the owner's confirmation, not an institutional clearance letter
or an independent legal determination. No repository visibility change is
requested. Source licensing does not clear third-party data rights.

The optional Seko SQLite database and its research are separately attributed in
README; the upstream Python script and full database are not bundled. Eight
composition/score pairs in the tiny SQLite fixture match the upstream README,
and some are repeated in examples, tests and precompilation. Earlier descriptions
of all these rows as invented were incorrect. The upstream BSD 3-Clause notice
is retained in [third-party notices](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), with exact scope
and source revision. Original Eka code remains MIT. This is not a blanket grant
over the full database or the sources underlying it.

The recovery pilot and label-sensitivity experiments use Materials Project API
data, not Seko scores; the latter remain excluded from the primary experiment.
Frozen local evidence retains its historical text and hashes; this register
records the subsequent software-licensing decision.

## Materials Project terms evidence

The owner supplied the MP Terms of Use on 31 August 2026. The text explicitly
permits API analysis and presenting processed results with attribution, and
licenses downloaded Content under **CC BY 4.0**. The supplied text, checksum,
source caveat and application to all six retained fields are recorded in the
[terms evidence review](mp-terms-evidence.md).

This supersedes the earlier missing-text blocker. A read-only check of the live
official page on 31 August 2026 confirmed the same material grant and requirements.
A separate provider permission request is not required by that text for uses
within its grant. Specific exceptions and the contents of any proposed data
bundle remain to be checked; do not apply MIT to MP data.
GNoME remains excluded, and external database identifiers do not license the
underlying third-party records. Original source records/structures are not bundled.

## Artifact-by-artifact status

| Category | Basis established so far | Attribution / notices to preserve | Restrictions and unresolved questions | Current release status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Eka original code and methodological documentation | Owner confirms authority; MIT applied in root LICENSE | Joshua Corbett; MIT copyright and permission notice | Third-party material retains its own terms; this is not data clearance | Original software licensed under MIT |
| Dependencies | Installed source licence files inspected for the recorded versions; core Julia packages below have MIT notices | Preserve each package's copyright and licence notices when distributing covered code | Wrapper licences do not cover wrapped binaries; transitive/native/Python components require artifact-specific review if bundled | Conditional component evidence only; no blanket bundle clearance |
| Test fixtures and examples | Original synthetic MP/benchmark fixtures; tiny SQLite fixture includes eight Seko README pairs and four original rows | MIT for original material; retained upstream BSD notice for reused pairs | Do not label reused pairs invented or infer full-database rights; see third-party notices | Software-example notices supplied; live source datasets remain separate |
| Aggregate results and plots | Computed locally; current official MP terms permit covered adaptations with attribution | MP citation, version/date, source, protocol, transformations and limitations | Apply attribution and transformation notices; review any specific exception and final contents | Attributed aggregate prose in the source archive reviewed; standalone result bundle remains separate |
| Composition records | MP API composition/formula fields; source and transformation hashes retained | MP source/version/date, composition normalization and grouping changes | Supplied CC BY Content grant is the working basis; current-version applicability and specific exceptions remain a final review item | Preparation supported for covered content; records remain local |
| Provenance fields | MP flags, IDs and source references retained and grouped | MP attribution; third-party attribution where established | General Content grant is evidence, not field-specific provider confirmation; do not infer underlying database rights | Review source-specific notices; no original ICSD/Pauling records distributed |
| Other derived artifacts | Splits, candidate-level rankings, policy labels, audit tables and detailed diagnostics transform MP records | Source, protocol, hashes, representation and processing history | Retain CC BY attribution for covered content and identify transformations; review source-specific exceptions | Preparation supported for covered content; no automatic publication |
| Environment and run records | Project/Manifest, source hashes and local reproduction instructions are captured | Package notices if actual sources/binaries are bundled | Review paths, source archives, logs, licences and data-bearing files separately; a lockfile is not a dependency licence | Source archive excludes local runs, environment lockfile and logs; full environments remain local |

## Dependency evidence captured

Installed licence notices were read for ArgParse 1.2.0, DBInterface 2.7.0,
SQLite.jl 1.8.2, PrecompileTools 1.3.4, SHA 0.7.0 and TOML 1.0.3. These provide
MIT-style source-code grants with notice requirements. SQLite_jll 3.53.2+0
explicitly distinguishes its MIT wrapper code from the bundled binary's terms.
Do not extend any of those grants to Eka, MP records or a complete runtime bundle.

A local inventory of 30 Julia package source locations and discovered licence
files, plus copies/hashes of the reviewed notices, is preserved under
`reports/local/mp-label-sensitivity-v1-2026-08-31/`. It is not a completed
transitive/native/Python redistribution audit. The proposed source package should
not vendor those environments by accident.

## Open actions

1. Use the confirmed current MP terms and CC BY 4.0 as the working basis for
   covered content. Before a record-level data release, check specific exceptions,
   required notices and whether MP guidance is appropriate for the concrete
   repackaging plan. The older blanket clarification request remains unsent.
2. Preserve the applied MIT licence and scoped third-party notices in source
   distributions. The owner-confirmation and code-licence decision are complete;
   further incorporated material requires its own provenance review.
3. Re-run `python scripts/verify_release.py --archive <treeish>` on the exact
   source release commit. Review any later proposed data or runtime bundle as a
   distinct artifact; keep unresolved material excluded.

For the 0.1.1 release, the evidence-bundle decision is **do not publish**. The
source-only release does not need it, and no final file-by-file contents,
source-specific exception, attribution, environment or credential/path review
has been completed for the record-level MP data, rankings, factors and runtime
artifacts. This is a deferral, not a finding that such a bundle cannot be
published after its separate review.

The environment restore, original-code licensing, current MP terms check and
source-candidate content review are complete. Any record-level data/runtime
bundle and specific source exceptions remain separate from MIT software licensing.
