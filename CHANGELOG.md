# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A Documenter site (`docs/make.jl`, `docs/Project.toml`, `docs/src/`) built and
  deployed by a `Documentation` job in continuous integration. The build assembles
  a gitignored staging tree and copies all 27 canonical documents into it byte for
  byte, so the content-hash-pinned protocols and the provenance-manifest keys are
  untouched. `checkdocs = :exports` ties the reference to the API contract: the
  manual must cover every exported name. Five examples in the getting-started
  guide execute against the shipped fixture at build time. GitHub Pages must be
  pointed at the `gh-pages` branch once before the site is reachable; `/stable/`
  appears at the next tag, as `v0.1.0` predates the site.
- A dev-documentation badge in the README.

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: setup, the three test commands and the release gate, the
  frozen protocol documents and provenance paths, the frozen v1 command-line
  surface, and the distinction between a software fix and a new experiment.

- Aqua.jl package-quality checks in the test suite. This required `[compat]`
  entries for the test-only extras (`Aqua`, `Random`, `Test`), which Aqua's
  dependency check inspects alongside `[deps]`. Method ambiguities, unbound type
  parameters and type piracy were already clean. Adding Aqua changes
  `Project.toml`, and so changes recorded `implementation_hashes` for subsequent
  research runs; manifest keys are unaffected.
- Coverage processing and upload on the Ubuntu current-Julia job. Upload is
  non-blocking and needs a `CODECOV_TOKEN` repository secret to report.
- Python 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 in continuous integration, alongside 3.11. The four
  independent analysers moved into their own `analysis` job so they actually
  receive the version matrix; they previously ran only under 3.11 in the Julia
  job, which the exporter job's matrix would not have covered.
- Dependabot for GitHub Actions versions, and a CompatHelper workflow for Julia
  bounds. `scripts/requirements-mp.txt` is deliberately excluded from automated
  bumps.

- `docs/api-stability.md`: the 0.1.x public API contract. Exported names are
  classified stable, stable-command-line, or experimental; database-schema and
  generated-report-format guarantees are stated, including that `schema_version`
  is written as an integer by most producers but as a string by
  `import_compositions`, a wart deferred to 0.2.0 rather than corrected now.
- `test/test_api.jl` makes that contract executable: adding an exported name
  without classifying it fails the suite.
- Docstrings for `ranking_value`, `rank_by_score` and `rank_by_similarity`, the
  last three exported names without them. All 27 exports are now documented.
- The provenance-path guard now covers the `mp_system_holdout` and
  `mp_label_sensitivity` code lists, which hold three of the five `docs/` paths
  used as manifest keys and were previously unguarded.

### Changed

- Research modules (`mp_label_sensitivity.jl`, `mp_system_holdout.jl`,
  `element_pair_model.jl`, `mp_element_pair.jl`) are now loaded by the package as
  an internal `EkaCompositions.Research` namespace instead of being included
  manually by each script and test. Source paths are unchanged, so provenance
  manifest keys stay comparable with earlier runs; recorded
  `implementation_hashes` values change, as they do for any source edit. Nothing
  is exported and no research subcommand is added to the CLI, so the frozen v1
  query, ranking and `benchmark-pu` surfaces are unaffected.
- Removed the nested `include` calls that previously caused a single session to
  define more than one copy of `MPLabelSensitivity` and `MPSystemHoldout`.

### Added

- Tests for the maintenance and measurement scripts that previously had none:
  `benchmark_query.jl`, `benchmark_pu_similarity.jl`, `verify_production.jl` and
  `run_pair_feasibility.jl`. The system-holdout analysis test now drives
  `scripts/run_system_holdout.jl` itself rather than calling the module inline,
  so every research entry point is executed by the suite.
- Tests for `mp_element_pair.jl`, which had no coverage: protocol and baseline
  pin shape, output-overwrite guards, sibling module identity, and a check that
  every path recorded in a provenance manifest resolves on disk.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- The `EkaCompositions` Julia package and `eka` command-line entry point.
- Canonical, validated chemical compositions with ratio reduction, deterministic
  equality and hashing, and explicit rejection of unsupported formula syntax.
- Read-only queries for standard and supported legacy SQLite score databases,
  with element, arity, and score filters plus deterministic score or
  reference-composition-similarity ranking.
- A command-line interface for querying, importing, and auditing score databases.
- Transactional TSV import of existing composition scores with duplicate policy,
  source provenance, checksums, and no-overwrite publication.
- Reproducible fixed-budget ranking benchmarks with random and training-element
  popularity baselines, full rankings, recovery metrics, and input snapshots.
- Materials Project snapshot export and audit tooling that preserves selected
  source records, groups equivalent compositions, and distinguishes positive,
  unlabelled, and unresolved provenance groups.
- Deterministic positive-unlabelled recovery splits and evaluation using random,
  training-only element-popularity, and maximum-composition-similarity methods.
- Separately versioned research workflows for positive-label sensitivity,
  chemical-system holdout, and a fixed-compute element-pair factor comparator.
- Julia-native offline synthetic snapshot generation and external-score coverage
  inspection. Python remains optional for live Materials Project export and is
  used for independent saved-output validation.
- Reproducibility documentation, synthetic examples, citation metadata,
  third-party notices, and an automated source-release content audit.

### Changed

- The offline fixture-to-evaluation example now runs entirely in Julia.

### Fixed

- Snapshot audits reconcile preserved JSONL records with normalized TSV inputs
  and verify exporter or producer metadata before recovery evaluation.
- Source-release audits reject symbolic links, hard links, special archive
  members, unreviewed data files, and machine-specific paths.

### Security

- SQLite databases are opened in read-only mode, and import and report workflows
  refuse to overwrite existing destinations.
- Materials Project exporter diagnostics withhold external exception text and
  request details that could expose API credentials.
- Release auditing checks source archives for common credential and private-key
  patterns before publication.
